# Cloud Based Storage Application
We have implemented cloud based application similar to dropbox where user can download, upload, delete and edit the files.

## Features

- User can upload multiple files to the server using UDP Protocol, creating multiple threads and buffers
- Data is  Synchronized and stored on a cloud storage and its status is sent to the server.
- File is transmitted using blocks because if error occurs while transmission than only those - blocks which are not transmitted will be send again instead of sending whole file again.
- Multiple users can works together on one server.
